## Inspiration 🍯
### Did you know that...
  🐝 Honey bees perform about **80% of all pollination** worldwide <br/>
  🐝 70 of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about **90% of the world’s nutrition** — are pollinated by bees. <br/>
### But also...
  🐝 Honey bees have declined from about 6 million hives to 2.4 million hives, a **60% reduction**, from 1947 to 2008<br/>
  🐝 In the US the number of bee colonies per hectare has **declined by 90%** since 1962 

<br/>
There are **various factors** affecting the bees' lifespan, some of which are: <br/>
👉 Drought <br/>
👉 Habitat destruction <br/>
👉 Pesticides <br/>
👉 Global warming <br/>
👉 Air pollution <br/>
👉 Nutrition deficit <br/>


**Solving even some of these issues can drastically improve the outlook for bees, which is what we aim to do with _BeeBuzz_. 🐝** 

<br/>

## What it does 🍯
_BeeBuzz_ consists of sensors and a webpage which: <br/> 
🐝 enable beekeepers to **map** 🗺  their hives<br/> 
🐝 track the **hives' condition** <br/> 
🐝 **notify** for any abnormalities in the **temperature** and **humidity** level of the hives<br/>
🐝 Save the data to a **database** for retention<br/>

<br/>

## How we built it 🍯
_BeeBuzz_ is saving the bees with the help of: <br/>
👉 **Figma** <br/>
👉 **HTML** & **CSS** <br/> 
👉 **JavaScript** <br/>
👉 **Python** <br/>
👉 **Bootstrap** <br/>
👉 **Flask** <br/>
👉 **CockroachDB** <br/>
👉 **Raspberry Pi**<br/>
👉 **DHT 22 Temperature and Humidity sensor**<br/>

<br/>

## Challenges we ran into 🍯

⌛ Creating the whole project within such a short **time** frame was certainly a challenge for us <br/>
⌛ It was the first time we experimented with hardware and debugging was difficult as we were using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO for the first time<br/>
<br/>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🍯

👏 We are proud of finishing it and submitting it to this hackathon <br/>
👏 We managed to successfully get real time readings from the sensor which we thought was quite difficult! <br/>
<br/>

## What we learned 🍯

🐝 How to interact with the Pi's GPIO in real time <br/>
🐝 Getting sensor values in real time <br/>
🐝 Implementing CockroachDB in our project<br/>

<br/>

## What's next for _BeeBuzz_ 🍯

👉 We plan to add an array of sensors, so one Raspberry Pi can manage lots of sensors thus reducing the cost<br/>
👉 We also plan to use i2C based addressing for sensors, so we can push the limits of the Pi and add lots of sensors to one single Raspberry Pi<br/>
